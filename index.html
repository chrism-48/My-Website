        <p>Hi, my name is Chris Moore. I currently work in manufacturing. I work in an <a id="molding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_moulding">Injection molding</a> plant. I have been in this field since 1992. My job is called a process technician.
            In 2019, I started my journey to see if I could learn how to code. Learning as a self taught developer is interesting. I picked up pieces of as much as I could in a definitely non structured way. If I knew what I know now I would have taken
            computer classes at my technical college. Back then in 1990, we did not think a thing about a computer. Anyway, as of now I am looking for a front end developer or any other kind of programming job where I can get my foot in the door. The
            image above I felt like represents the road I have taken to get here.
